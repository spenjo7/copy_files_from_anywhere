# Copy Files From Anywhere ( aka 'clone' )

## Introduction
Copy Files From Anywhere ( aka 'clone' ) is a lightweight BASH script which copies files/subfolders from a predefined source to whichever directory the clone command is being called from. Perfect for getting "Boilerplate" or template-type files into new projects. 

### Why clone?
Clone was built because I often use a similar file set up for new scripting projects. Rather than spending time setting up my index.html, styles.css and scripts.js; I decided to pour way more time into this project so that I don't ever have to do it again. :-) 
Realistically though, it can be used for any file(s) which you need frequently make copies of.   

### Will clone maintain the folder structure of my template files?
Yes.

### What if I have multiple sets of files that I want to copy?
Clone includes an option to choose an alternate source folder at runtime.

## Using Clone - Important, read carefully!
